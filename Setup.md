# Setup

## OS

The OS of the backend should be a RHEL distro. The recommended OS for this is [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/) as it's downstream, and thus more stable.


## Setup Script

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtheranTimes/backend/main/scripts/setup.sh -o setup.sh
sudo sh setup.sh
```
